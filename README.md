<p>There's so much violence and hate in this world, and it's really stressing everybody out. We decided we needed to create a way for people to let out their stress in a way that doesn't hurt others. Also, itâ€™s only a matter of time before the zombie apocalypse, and that's pretty stressful too.</p>



<h3 id="what-it-does">What It Does</h3>

<p>Kyle can be whatever you want him to beâ€“ a cute stuffed animal, or a keyboard emulating controller for computer games, or just a friend to talk to to help debug faulty code. The Java game itself is a maze that the player navigates while trying to kill zombies. The longer you survive and the more zombies you kill, the better.</p>



<h3 id="how-we-built-it">How We Built It</h3>

<p>We used keyboard emulator to map buttons on Kyle to different keys on the keyboard. We also designed the first-person shooter game in Java specifically to be played using Kyle as a controller. The maze used in the game is createdThe 3D graphics implement raycasting.</p>

<ol>
<li>Designing an efficient pathfinding algorithm for the zombies in our game.</li>
<li>Adding graphics to the game (giving the walls textures). </li>
<li>Preserving the appearance of Kyle while disemboweling and re-emboweling him several times.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="accomplishments-that-were-proud-of">Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h3>

<ol>
<li>Managing to design, create, and submit an entry with a team of first-time hackers without mentors.</li>
<li>Successfully creating a Beta version with textures.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>How raycasting works.</li>
<li>Playing computer games is more fun using a penguin as a controller controller than a keyboard.</li>
