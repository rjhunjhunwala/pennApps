Inspiration

There's so much violence and hate in this world, and it's really stressing everybody out. Also, it's only a matter of time before the zombie apocalypse, and that's pretty stressful too.

What it does

Kyle can be whatever you want him to be--a cute stuffed animal, or a keyboard emulating controller for computer games, or just a friend to talk to to help debug faulty code.

How we built it

We used Makey-Makey, a keyboard emulator, to map buttons on Kyle to different keys on the keyboard. We also designed a first-person shooter game in Java specifically to be played using Kyle as a controller.

Challenges we ran into

--Designing a pathfinding algorithm for the zombies in our game. --Addiing graphics to the game (giving the walls textures). --Preserving the appearance of Kyle while disemboweling and re-emboweling him several times.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

--Managing to design, create, and submit an entry with a team of first-time hackers without mentors.

What we learned

--Playing computer games is more fun using a controller than a keyboard.

What's next for Stress Penguin

--Make the game run faster. --Make the game more complex. --Improved graphics
